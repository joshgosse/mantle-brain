# Affiliate Program — Implementation Spec (for agents)

> **Audience:** a coding agent implementing a referral/affiliate program — tracked

## 0. Goal & invariants

Build a program where affiliates share a tracked link, the installs they drive are
attributed to them, the revenue those installs generate accrues commission under
your rules, and commission is paid out through your payment provider.

The invariants that keep it correct:

1. **The handle is the spine.** Every (affiliate, program) membership has a unique
   `handle` — the `mref` code — and it appears in the link as `?mref=<handle>`.
   Resolution is always *scoped to the program/app*: the same handle string may
   exist in another program.
2. **One active attribution per install.** This is enforced in *application code +
   a lock*, not by the schema. You MUST pick a de-dup policy (first- or last-
   write-wins) and apply it consistently.
3. **Commissions are derived, not posted inline.** A sweep reads each referred
   install's transactions since a per-affiliate cursor and mints commission rows.
   The sweep is incremental and idempotent (dedup by `(affiliate, transaction)`).
4. **Rule resolution is a deliberate non-merge.** When a `custom` membership
   override or an attribution snapshot applies, the parent's *commission fields*
   are dropped wholesale, not inherited; a `group` override drops only the
   commission fields the group itself defines (a per-field merge). This is the
   logic that is easiest to get wrong when you reimplement it.
5. **Payout = aggregate then pay.** Stage 1 buckets outstanding commissions into a
   payout (gated by a minimum). Stage 2 disburses it through your payment provider.
   They are separate; money only moves in stage 2.
6. **Aggregation is idempotent and locked.** Payout aggregation runs under a
   per-affiliate lock and is safe to re-run. Disbursing a payout through a payment
   provider is out of scope for this spec (see §8).

If you preserve these six, the rest is bookkeeping.

## 1. Data model

Field names are illustrative — map them to your schema. If your app is
single-tenant, drop the `organization_id` scoping everywhere and collapse
`affiliate_user` + `affiliate` into one table.

### 1.1 `affiliate_users` — the global login identity
One person, across all merchants/programs. Holds payout identity + portal auth.
- `id`, `email` (**globally unique**), `name?`, `username?` (unique),
  `email_verified_at?`, `image_url?`
- payout identity: a destination for your payment provider (e.g. a payout email or
  connected-account id — shape it to your provider), plus `country_code?`, `type`
  (`person`|`company`), address fields, `tax_id?`
- `google_id_token JSON?` (optional OAuth), `password?` (**legacy — not checked at
  login**, see §9)

### 1.2 `affiliates` — the per-merchant earner
- `id`, `organization_id`, `email` (**unique only within a merchant**, NOT
  global), `name?`, `user_id?` → `affiliate_users`
- `agreed_to_terms_at?` (merchant-level terms), `payout_hold` (bool — blocks
  payouts), `tags String[]`
- sweep cursors: `last_transaction_date?`, `last_app_installation_date?` (so the
  commission scanner only re-processes new transactions/installs)
- `start_counting_commission_from?` (per-affiliate commission cutoff, set on import)
- `deleted_at?` (soft delete), `redacted_at?` (PII scrub)

### 1.3 `affiliate_programs` — a program (per app)
- `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `app_id?` (programs are per-app)
- `rules JSON @default("{}")` (the economics — see §2)
- join policy: `require_approval_to_join` (bool), `require_terms_acceptance`
  (bool), `terms_url?`, `required_affiliate_fields JSON`
- `custom_affiliate_link?` (overrides the default base URL),
  `remove_on_uninstall_days Int @default(-1)` (-1 = never auto-remove attribution
  on uninstall; ≥0 = grace window), `start_counting_commission_from?`
- portal flags: `branding JSON?`, `show_in_marketplace` (bool),
  `allow_affiliate_dashboard_access` (bool)

### 1.4 `affiliate_memberships` — joins an affiliate to a program
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_id`, `affiliate_program_id`
- **`handle?` — THE `mref` referral code.** Unique per
  `(organization_id, affiliate_program_id, handle)`.
- `rules JSON?` (per-affiliate override), `rules_override String?` — a
  **discriminator**, one of `null` / `"group"` / `"custom"` (selects which rule
  tier wins — see §6.2). `rules` is ignored unless `rules_override === "custom"`.
- `status String @default("pending")` — observed values `pending`, `enrolled`,
  `rejected`
- `group_id?` → `affiliate_groups`, `from_marketplace` (bool)
- invite lifecycle: `invited_at?`, `invited_by_id?`, `invite_accepted_at?`,
  `invite_rejected_at?`
- approval lifecycle: `approval_requested_at?`, `approved_at?`, `rejected_at?`,
  `approval_decision_by_id?`
- `agreed_to_terms_at?` (program-level terms), `deleted_at?`

### 1.5 `affiliate_groups` — a named rate tier inside a program (optional)
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_program_id`, `name`, `rules JSON?`,
  `show_in_marketplace`

### 1.6 `affiliate_attributions` — the output of attribution
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_id`, `affiliate_program_id`,
  `app_installation_id` → the referred install
- `date?` (referral date), `rules JSON?` (**snapshot at attribution time —
  highest precedence**), `deleted_at?`
- **No DB uniqueness on `app_installation_id`** — the "one active attribution"
  invariant is code + lock (§5).

### 1.7 `affiliate_commissions` — one earned amount
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_id`, `affiliate_program_id`
- `affiliate_attribution_id?`, `transaction_id?` (the billing event that generated
  it), `app_installation_id?`
- `type String?` — `signup` | `percent` | `install` | `custom`
- `amount Float`, `date?`, `name?`, `notes?`
- `cancelled Boolean @default(false)`, `cancel_reason?` (manual void — see §6.5)
- `payout_id?` (set when rolled into a payout; **nulled on cancel**),
  `deleted_at?`
- No DB uniqueness on `(transaction, type)` — dedup is in code (§6.4).

### 1.8 `affiliate_payouts` — the aggregation bucket
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_id`, `affiliate_program_id?`
- `number Int?` — **per-merchant sequential** invoice-like number
  (`unique(organization_id, number)`)
- `status String @default("pending")` — `pending` → `requested` → `processing` →
  `paid`, or `cancelled`
- `amount Float` (gross commission total), `amount_paid Float?` (net actually paid)
- `period_start?`, `period_end?` (chains off the previous paid payout's end),
  `paid_at?`, `paid_by_id?`, `payment_method?`, `payment_method_data JSON?`,
  `payment_requested_at?`

### 1.9 Payout-rail bookkeeping (out of scope)
The actual payment integration — your provider's funding source, connection/OAuth
records, and batch/transfer bookkeeping — is **out of scope for this spec.** Model
it to fit whatever provider you disburse through (see §8).

### 1.10 `affiliate_events` — the lifecycle-event spine
- `id`, `organization_id`, `affiliate_id`, `affiliate_program_id?`,
  `membership_id?`, `attribution_id?`, `payout_id?`
- `type String` (§10), `date?`

### 1.11 Merchant-level payout config (on your `organization`/settings)
- `affiliate_minimum_payout_amount` (default 0), `affiliate_payout_start_number`
  (default 1000)
- `affiliate_auto_payout_enabled` (default false), `affiliate_auto_payout_schedule?`
  (`weekly`|`biweekly`|`monthly`), `affiliate_auto_payout_day_of_week?` /
  `_day_of_month?`, `affiliate_auto_payout_last_run_at?`

---

## 2. The rules JSON shape

The economics of a program (or group, or membership override, or attribution
snapshot). Sanitize on write: coerce numerics with `parseFloat`/`parseInt`, filter
`revenueComponents` against the allow-list, default an invalid `revenueType` to
`"gross"`, and **drop any absent field**.

```js
{
  percentCommission: 20,                 // recurring % of each qualifying transaction
  durationMonths: 12,                    // commission window length; 0/absent = lifetime
  amountPerInstall: 5.00,                // one-time flat bounty per referred install
  signupBonus: 10.00,                    // one-time bonus on the install's FIRST eligible transaction
  minPlanValue: 49.00,                   // gate: skip if the install's ACTIVE plan price < this
  revenueComponents: ["subscription"],   // subset of ["subscription","usage","one-time"]; empty/absent = all
  revenueType: "gross"                   // "gross" | "net" — which transaction amount to pay on
}
```

- **There is no cap field.** The only bounds are `durationMonths` (time) and
  `minPlanValue` (eligibility). A per-referral payout cap is your job to add.
- **`durationMonths` is coerced behind a truthy check**, so a literal
  `durationMonths: 0` is silently dropped (treated as absent = lifetime). You
  cannot persist an explicit `0`; treat absent as lifetime.

The four **commission fields** — `["percentCommission","durationMonths",
"revenueComponents","minPlanValue"]` — are the ones subject to the non-merge rule
in §6.2. The rest (`amountPerInstall`, `signupBonus`, `revenueType`) always fall
through.

---

## 3. External surface

### 3.1 The tracked link
```
baseUrl = program.custom_affiliate_link || "https://apps.shopify.com/<your-app-slug>"
link    = baseUrl + (baseUrl.includes("?") ? "&" : "?") + "mref=" + membership.handle
```
The `apps.shopify.com` base is the only Shopify-specific part. **For a non-App-
Store funnel, replace `baseUrl` with your own signup/landing URL.**

### 3.2 The client capture script (reuse almost verbatim)
A ~200-line vanilla-JS snippet placed on your marketing pages:
1. Read the referral code from the URL: `mref || utm_source || ref` (that
   precedence).
2. Persist it under a stable key (e.g. `affiliate_referral`) in a **cookie with a
   30-day expiry**, falling back to `sessionStorage` if cookies are unavailable.
3. Expose it (e.g. `window.affiliateTrack.referralCode`) so your signup page can
   read it.
4. (Optional) If given a `link_url` param, rewrite every `<a>` whose href points at
   your signup host to carry `?mref=<code>`.

Your signup/account-creation call MUST forward the stored code to the attribution
endpoint (§5).

### 3.3 Payout disbursement (out of scope)
Paying a payout out to an affiliate goes through your own payment provider (PayPal
Payouts, Stripe Connect, bank transfer, …). That integration is **out of scope for
this spec** — see §8 for the provider-agnostic contract it must satisfy.

---

## 4. Procedure: enroll / join

```
enrollAffiliate(org, program, affiliate, { requestedAt?, requireApproval, handleSeed }):
    # idempotent: if a non-deleted membership already exists, return it unchanged
    existing = membership(org, program, affiliate, deletedAt=null)
    if existing: return existing

    # assign a unique handle (the mref code)
    handle = handleSeed || username || slug(name) || localPart(email)
    while handleExists(org, program, handle):
        handle = `${handle}-${rand()}`

    # status
    if requestedAt and program.require_approval_to_join: status = "pending"
    else:                                                status = "enrolled"

    m = createMembership(org, program, affiliate, handle, status)
    emit AffiliateEvent(requestedAt ? "join_requested" : "joined")
    return m

approveMembership(m):  m.status = "enrolled"; emit "join_approved"; emit "joined"   # TWO events
rejectMembership(m):   m.status = "rejected"; emit "join_denied"
```

- **MUST keep enrollment idempotent** — a re-join returns the existing membership.
- Approval emits **both** `join_approved` and `joined`.

---

## 5. Procedure: attribution

```
attributeReferralCode(code, appInstallation, date, { affiliateProgram or appId }):
    membership = findMembership(handle=code, deletedAt=null, program scoped to appId,
                                status="enrolled")        # MUST scope to the app/program
    if not membership: return null
    return attributeAffiliateToAppInstallation(membership.affiliate, membership.program,
                                               appInstallation, date)

attributeAffiliateToAppInstallation(affiliate, program, appInstallation, date):
    active = appInstallation.attributions where deletedAt=null      # spans ALL programs on this install
    existing = active.find(a => a.affiliate==affiliate AND a.program==program)

    # de-dup policy (LAST-write-wins shown; choose ONE and document it):
    # Soft-deleting the whole `active` set (except `existing`) enforces ONE active
    # attribution per install ACROSS programs — Mantle's behavior. Alternatives:
    #   first-write-wins      → if active.length > 0: return active[0]   (ignore the new referral)
    #   per-(install,program) → filter `active` to a.program == program before deleting
    if active.length > 0:
        softDelete(active where id != existing?.id)       # deletedAt = now

    if not existing:
        attribution = createAttribution(affiliate, program, appInstallation, date,
                                        rules=optionalSnapshot)
        runAttributionCreatedSideEffects(...)             # see below
    else:
        if existing.date != date: updateDate(existing, date)
        attribution = existing
    return attribution

runAttributionCreatedSideEffects(affiliate, program, appInstallation, attribution):
    affiliate.last_transaction_date = null                # force the sweep to re-scan history
    enqueue commission sweep for affiliate
    createInstallCommission(affiliate, program, appInstallation, attribution)   # §6.5 INSTALL
    emit AffiliateEvent("referral")
```

- **MUST scope handle resolution to the app/program** — the same handle can exist
  in another program.
- **MUST pick a single de-dup policy.** First-write-wins is recommended (return the
  existing attribution untouched). The shown last-write-wins soft-deletes prior
  active attributions and recreates. **Guard concurrency with a per-install lock**
  (e.g. `attributeHandle:<appInstallationId>`) — the natural `created_at` ordering
  does not reliably reflect commit order.
- **MUST only attribute `enrolled` memberships.**
- Side effects are part of attribution: reset the re-scan cursor, mint the install
  bounty, emit `referral`.

> **Shopify note:** the App Store strips query params on install, so the `mref`
> won't reach your backend automatically. Carry it yourself (§3.2 → your signup
> call). Mantle *also* reconstructed attribution from a Google-Analytics→BigQuery
> bridge to work around this — **skip that entirely** if you control your funnel.

---

## 6. Procedure: the commission sweep

### 6.1 Trigger
Two ways into the same function:
1. Enqueued immediately when an attribution is created/changed (debounced per
   affiliate).
2. A **daily cron** (Mantle: `0 0 9 * * *`).

### 6.2 Rule resolution (the non-merge — port the unit tests verbatim)
Precedence highest-first: **attribution.rules > membership(custom) > group >
program**. Let `COMMISSION_FIELDS = ["percentCommission","durationMonths",
"revenueComponents","minPlanValue"]`.

```
resolveRules(program, membership, attribution):
    groupRules = (membership.rules_override == "group" ? (membership.group?.rules || {}) : {})
    fallback   = { ...program.rules,
                   ...groupRules,
                   ...(membership.rules_override == "custom" ? (membership.rules || {}) : {}) }

    if attribution.rules:                       # attribution snapshot wins outright (FULL drop)
        return { ...omit(fallback, COMMISSION_FIELDS), ...attribution.rules }

    if membership.rules_override == "custom":   # FULL drop: program commission fields do NOT leak through
        return { ...omit(fallback, COMMISSION_FIELDS), ...(membership.rules || {}) }

    if membership.rules_override == "group" and (groupRules.percentCommission or
                                                 groupRules.amountPerInstall):
        toOmit = COMMISSION_FIELDS.filter(f => groupRules[f] !== undefined)   # PER-FIELD drop
        return { ...omit(fallback, toOmit), ...groupRules }

    return fallback
```

- **`custom` and attribution overrides do a FULL drop** of the four
  `COMMISSION_FIELDS` from the fallback — even a `custom` override with empty `{}`
  strips program `minPlanValue` / `durationMonths` / `revenueComponents` /
  `percentCommission`. An explicit `minPlanValue: 0` in the override DOES win (it is
  a set value, not absent).
- **A `group` override is a PER-FIELD merge** — it drops only the commission fields
  the group itself defines, so any it leaves undefined still fall through from the
  program. This asymmetry is real; don't "fix" it into a full drop unless you
  intend different semantics.
- `amountPerInstall`, `signupBonus`, `revenueType` are NOT commission fields and
  always fall through.

### 6.3 The scan
Each install has at most one active attribution (§5), so each transaction maps to a
single `(program, attribution)` to process under.
```
checkCommissionsForAffiliate(affiliate):
    installs = distinct app_installation_ids of affiliate's active attributions
    cursor   = max(affiliate.last_transaction_date, affiliate.start_counting_commission_from)
    for each batch of 200 transactions of those installs,
        ordered by date asc, where date > cursor:
        for tx in batch:
            attribution = active attribution for tx's install         # ≤1 per install (§5)
            membership  = membership(affiliate, attribution.program)
            processTransaction(affiliate, attribution.program, membership,
                               attribution, tx.install, tx)
        affiliate.last_transaction_date = batch.last.date             # advance cursor (idempotent)
```

### 6.4 The per-transaction gate chain (each gate is a WHOLE-transaction skip)
A failed gate skips this transaction entirely (`return`) — it does not fall through
to another program, because there is only one attribution per install.
```
processTransaction(affiliate, program, membership, attribution, install, tx):
    rules  = resolveRules(program, membership, attribution)
    amount = rules.revenueType == "net" ? tx.netAmount : tx.grossAmount

    if tx.grossAmount <= 0:                                 return   # refund/credit SILENTLY SKIPPED (no clawback)
    if tx.date < program.start_counting_commission_from:   return
    if tx.date < affiliate.start_counting_commission_from: return
    component = ({subscription_sale:"subscription", usage_sale:"usage",
                 one_time_sale:"one-time"})[tx.type]
    if rules.revenueComponents?.length and component not in rules.revenueComponents: return
    if rules.minPlanValue and install.activeSubscription
       and install.activeSubscription.plan?.amount < rules.minPlanValue:           return
    if commissionExists(affiliate, tx):                    return   # dedup: idempotent re-run; one tx → one set

    # earliest TRANSACTION-derived commission for (affiliate, program, install),
    # EXCLUDING this tx (idempotent re-runs) AND the install bounty (it has no
    # transaction id, so it must NOT set the window origin or suppress signup):
    earliest = earliestCommission(affiliate, program, install,
                                  excludeTransaction=tx, excludeType="install")

    # SIGNUP (one-time): only if no earlier commission exists for this program+install
    if not earliest and rules.signupBonus:
        createCommission(type="signup", amount=parseFloat(rules.signupBonus), tx)

    # PERCENT (recurring, per eligible transaction):
    if rules.percentCommission:
        windowStart    = earliest?.date              # window opens at the FIRST commission's date, else null
        durationMonths = rules.durationMonths || 0
        if windowStart and durationMonths and tx.date > addMonths(windowStart, durationMonths):
            pass                                     # past the window → no percent (boundary month INCLUDED: '>')
        else:
            createCommission(type="percent",
                             amount = amount * (parseFloat(rules.percentCommission) / 100), tx)
```

### 6.5 The other two commission types
- **INSTALL** (one-time per install): `createInstallCommission` at attribution time
  (§5). `amount = parseFloat(rules.amountPerInstall || 0)`; skip if ≤ 0; dated the
  install's `installed_at`; not subject to `durationMonths`.
- **CUSTOM**: only created by a manual admin action, never by the engine.

### 6.6 Cancellation (the only clawback path)
There is **no automatic refund clawback**. Voiding is a manual admin action that
sets `cancelled = true`, nulls `payout_id`, and re-runs payout generation. A
cancelled commission counts as zero in all totals.

### 6.7 Totals
- `totalCommission` = `sum(amount)` where `deleted_at = null AND cancelled = false`.
- `outstandingCommission` = same, further restricted to `payout_id = null OR
  payout.status = pending`.
- Both return **null (not 0)** when nothing matches — handle the empty case.

---

## 7. Procedure: payout aggregation (no money moves)

```
generatePayoutsForAffiliate(affiliate):
    lock(`AffiliatePayout:${affiliate.id}`, 5min):              # per-affiliate
        outstanding = commissions(affiliate, payout_id=null, deleted_at=null, cancelled=false)
        total = sum(outstanding.amount)
        minimum = org.affiliate_minimum_payout_amount ?? 0

        payout = openPendingPayout(affiliate)
        if not payout:
            if total <= 0 or total < minimum: return            # no empty payout; MUST gate NEW payout on minimum
            payout = createPayout(
                number      = max((lastOrgPayout?.number ?? 0) + 1,
                                  org.affiliate_payout_start_number ?? 1000),   # guard first-ever payout
                status      = "pending",
                period_start= previousPaidPayout?.period_end,    # chain periods
                period_end  = now)
            emit AffiliateEvent("payout_pending")

        stamp outstanding with payout.id
        payout.amount = sum(payout.commissions.amount)
```

- **MUST gate only NEW payout creation on the minimum.** Once a pending payout
  exists, more commissions append even below the minimum.
- **MUST run under a per-affiliate lock** and re-read inside it (idempotent re-run).
- Payout `number` is a per-merchant sequential invoice number, distinct from `id`.
- In Mantle, generation is enqueued **off the commission sweep** (so it rides the
  daily 9am cron), per merchant.

---

## 8. Procedure: payment

Disbursing a payout — the actual money movement — goes through **your own payment
provider** (PayPal Payouts, Stripe Connect, bank transfer, …) and is **out of
scope for this spec.** Below is only the provider-agnostic contract that wraps it.

A payment run:
1. Selects payable payouts (status `pending` or `requested`; skip `payout_hold`
   affiliates and any without a usable payout method).
2. Hands each to your provider to disburse to the affiliate.
3. On confirmed disbursement, calls `markPayoutAsPaid(payout, method)` →
   `status = "paid"`, `paid_at`, `amount_paid`, `payment_method`.
4. On failure, returns the payout to `pending` so it re-aggregates.

Provider-specific concerns belong **inside that integration, not here**:
idempotency on every money movement, verifying the destination can actually
receive funds before charging, any fee handling, and reconciling partial-batch
failures.

### 8.a Status lifecycle
`pending → requested → processing → paid`; `cancelled` detaches the commissions
back to `payout_id = null` (so they re-aggregate) and is refused once
paid/processing. Both `pending` and `requested` are payable.

### 8.b Auto-payout (optional)
A daily cron (Mantle: `0 0 10 * * *`) checks each merchant's
weekly/biweekly/monthly schedule (with a catch-up window + `last_run_at` guard),
selects eligible payouts (**excluding `payout_hold` affiliates and any without a
usable payout method**), and disburses them through your provider.

---

## 9. Affiliate portal & auth

A **separate auth stack** from your merchant/admin login — a signed session cookie
holding `{ id, email, otpVerified }`.

- **Passwordless / OTP-first.** POST email → find the affiliate-user (401 if none).
  **MUST NOT check the `password` field at login** (it is legacy). Write a 6-digit
  OTP to a short-TTL store (10 min, reused within TTL), email it as a code **and**
  a magic link. Verifying the OTP sets `otpVerified = true` and stamps
  `email_verified_at = now`.
- **"Remember me" is recomputed server-side** on each authenticated fetch as
  `email_verified_at within 30 days OR google_id_token present` — the stored
  session flag is not authoritative for the window.
- **Google OAuth** optional (code exchange → decode id_token → find/create user →
  `otpVerified = true`).
- **Identity linking (MUST):** on affiliate-user creation, connect any unlinked
  `affiliates` rows with the same (case-insensitive) email. This is what lets a
  pre-created/imported affiliate be adopted when the person signs up.
- **Two-tier terms:** merchant-level (`affiliate.agreed_to_terms_at`) and
  program-level (`membership.agreed_to_terms_at`).

Groups (rate tiers), assets (creative), a public marketplace, and Liquid branding
are **nice-to-haves** — none are required for attribution or commissions.

> **MUST scope asset downloads.** Authorize the *membership* (it belongs to the
> user) AND look up the asset **scoped to that membership's program**, enforcing
> the asset's own `visibility` / `group_ids` / `affiliate_ids` — never resolve an
> asset by id alone, so an affiliate can only reach assets in their own program.
> Guard the not-found/null case as a clean 404.

## 10. Events & webhooks

Route **every** lifecycle transition through one chokepoint that writes an
immutable event row and fans out to (1) outbound HTTP webhooks and (2) operator
notifications.

**The event types** (exactly these in Mantle): `join_requested`, `join_approved`,
`join_denied`, `joined`, `referral`, `referral_requested`, `payment_requested`,
`payout_pending`, `payout_cancelled`.

- **MUST NOT assume the obvious events exist.** There is **no `commission_earned`
  and no `payout_paid`** — commission earning is folded into `referral`; the money
  lifecycle is only `payout_pending` / `payment_requested` / `payout_cancelled`.
  **Add `commission_earned` / `payout_paid` yourself** if your customers want them.
- **Outbound webhook signing** (copy verbatim for integrator compatibility):
  ```
  secret  = webhook.signSecret || webhook.accessToken.client.secret
  X-Mantle-Hmac-SHA256 = hex( HMAC-SHA256(secret, `${unixSeconds}.${JSON.stringify(payload)}`) )
  headers: X-Timestamp (unix seconds), X-Mantle-Webhook-Topic, X-Mantle-Hmac-SHA256, X-Mantle-Org-Id
  POST, 5s timeout; non-2xx throws → retried (attempts: 10, exponential backoff, 1s base)
  ```
- **Notifications** are gated by a subscription model (which event types, which
  channel — slack/discord/email, recipients), deduped per `(event, rule, recipient)`.

## 11. MUST / MUST NOT rules (the gotchas)

Each encodes a deliberate design decision or a sharp edge worth getting right.
Treat as acceptance criteria.

- **MUST scope handle resolution to the app/program.** Same handle can exist in
  another program.
- **MUST pick and consistently apply ONE de-dup policy** for "one active
  attribution per install," across every entry path, guarded by a per-install lock.
- **MUST treat rule resolution as a non-merge** — a `custom` or attribution
  override drops ALL of the parent's commission fields (`percentCommission`,
  `durationMonths`, `revenueComponents`, `minPlanValue`), even with an empty
  override; a `group` override drops only the commission fields the group itself
  defines (per-field merge). **Port the rule-resolution unit tests verbatim.**
- **MUST decide your refund policy on purpose.** A non-positive transaction
  (`grossAmount <= 0`) earns nothing and is not auto-reversed; voiding a commission
  is an explicit admin action. If you promise "claw back on refund," build it.
- **MUST start the percent window at the first commission's date,** not the
  attribution date.
- **MUST attach the signup bonus to the first *eligible* transaction** (it fires
  only when no earlier commission exists).
- **MUST dedup per `(affiliate, transaction)`** — a transaction already commissioned
  is skipped on re-run (the sweep is idempotent). With one active attribution per
  install, a transaction yields at most one program's commission set.
- **MUST gate only NEW payout creation on the minimum** — commissions still append
  to an existing pending payout below it.
- **MUST run payout aggregation under a per-affiliate lock** and re-read inside it
  (idempotent re-run). Disbursement itself is handled by your provider integration
  (out of scope — §8).
- **MUST scope affiliate-asset downloads** to the membership's program and the
  asset's visibility (see §9) and guard the null case.
- **MUST NOT check the portal `password` field at login** — OTP is the gate.
- **MUST link affiliate rows by case-insensitive email** on user creation
  (pre-creation adoption).
- **Two email-uniqueness scopes** — global `affiliate_user.email`, per-merchant
  `affiliate.email`. Keep them distinct, linked by id.
- **Re-importing an affiliate by email revives a soft-deleted record** (clears
  `deleted_at`). Decide if that's desired.
- **MUST treat the event/audit table as non-load-bearing** — never let a webhook
  or notification failure block or corrupt a commission/payout write.

## 12. Caveats (read before going to production)

- **Currency is single-rail by default.** The model carries **no FX**: amounts are
  in the transaction's native units and imports assume `USD`. If you serve non-USD
  merchants, normalize currency explicitly across transaction amount, commission
  amount, and payout rather than assuming one.
- **Money precision.** If you compute amounts with floating point and only round at
  the payment boundary, stored values can carry float artifacts. For exact money,
  store integer minor units.
- **Skip the Shopify-only scaffolding.** The Google-Analytics→BigQuery attribution
  reconstruction exists solely because the App Store strips query params; drop it
  if you own your funnel. The competitor-importer pipeline is Mantle-specific —
  reuse only the import *shape* (match by case-insensitive email; import only
  already-paid historical payouts; set a per-affiliate
  `start_counting_commission_from` so you don't regenerate pre-migration
  commissions).

## 13. Acceptance scenarios

Implement and verify each:

1. **Enroll.** Joining issues a unique handle; re-joining returns the same
   membership unchanged. Approval emits both `join_approved` and `joined`.
2. **Link + capture.** The shared link carries `?mref=<handle>`; the client script
   stores the code 30 days and your signup forwards it.
3. **Attribution.** Forwarding the code writes ONE attribution (affiliate +
   program + install), fires the install bounty, resets the re-scan cursor, and
   emits `referral`. A second referral on the same install obeys your stated
   de-dup policy. Concurrent attribution doesn't create two active rows (lock).
4. **Handle scoping.** The same handle string in two programs resolves to the
   correct program when scoped by app.
5. **Percent commission.** An eligible subscription transaction mints a `percent`
   commission = `amount × pct/100`; each subsequent eligible transaction mints
   another until the `durationMonths` window (from the first commission's date)
   closes.
6. **Signup bonus.** Fires once, on the first eligible transaction; not again.
7. **Rule override non-merge.** Setting a membership to `custom` with `{}` drops
   the program's `minPlanValue`/`durationMonths`/`revenueComponents`/
   `percentCommission`; `amountPerInstall`/`signupBonus`/`revenueType` still apply.
8. **Gates.** A refund (`grossAmount <= 0`) mints nothing and is not clawed back;
   a sub-`minPlanValue` install mints nothing; a `revenueComponents`-excluded
   transaction mints nothing.
9. **Dedup.** One transaction never produces commissions for two programs.
10. **Payout aggregation.** Outstanding commissions roll into a `pending` payout
    only once past the minimum; below-minimum commissions still append to an
    existing pending payout; the payout gets the next per-merchant number and a
    chained period.
11. **Payment.** Disbursing a payable payout through your provider and confirming
    it calls `markPayoutAsPaid` (status `paid`, `amount_paid` set); a failed
    disbursement returns the payout to `pending`. (The provider integration itself
    is out of scope.)
12. **Cancellation.** Cancelling a commission nulls its `payout_id`, zeroes it in
    totals, and re-runs aggregation.
13. **Auto-payout.** Runs on the merchant's cadence; skips `payout_hold` and
    affiliates without a usable payout method.
14. **Portal.** OTP login works without a password; "remember me" honors the
    30-day verified window; a pre-created affiliate is adopted on signup by
    matching email; an asset download cannot read another program's asset id.
